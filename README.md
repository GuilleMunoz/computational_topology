An implementation in Python of a simplicial complex, a filtration, an Alpha complex and Vietoris-Rips complex.

---

## SimplicialComplex

A simplicial complex is a set os points, segments, ..., n-dimensional simplices.

---

## Filtration

A filtration is a sequence of a simplicial complexes.

---

## AlphaComplex

An AlphaComplex is a filtration determined by the Delaunay triangulation.
